## Summary

>I have 6+ years of experience in printing technologies. Having started my career as a layout designer at the university I graduated from, I became profficient not only in printing design but also in the production of advertising products. As a dependable and organized team player with the ability to communicate effectively and building relationships with employees across all levels of an organization, I was an acting director at an advertising agency. I led and managed a team of five in production of advertising from concept to delivery and installation. I launched a new production line in an advertising agency (production of printing products).
I like to move forward and improve by gaining new knowledge. I believe that I can be a reliable and valuable member of the front end development team.
